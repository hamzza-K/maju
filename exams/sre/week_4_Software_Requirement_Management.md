Introduction
Requirements management is the process of documenting, analyzing, tracing, prioritizing and
agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating to relevant
stakeholders. If you want your organization to be successful it means that you must deliver results.
In today’s competitive business environment there is no room for failed projects and stale
performance. Every company’s goal is to be successful long term and it’s becoming more and
more difficult as markets are expanding globally at a much faster rate than ever before.
Requirements management keeps your team in sync with one another and provides visibility into
what is actually happening and when it’s happening throughout the entire project. It’s very
important for the entire team to understand what the goal of the project is and how that specific
goal will be reached. It’s also important for all those involved in the project to have a mutual
understanding of requirements management in order for the project to be successful. If everyone
completely understands the requirements it allows for better acceptance of the goals and feedback
on all the decisions being made on a specific requirement. Look at requirements as an avenue for
communicating the needs and providing the validation of the projects results.
It is known that some primary reasons projects fail is because requirements are incomplete,
defective, or just lack the details provided by the customer. Incomplete requirements can also
produce inaccurate products, unplanned costs, and schedule delays. Requirements must be
carefully evaluated through analysis of user requirements and well documented to better
understand the client’s needs. It’s important to remember that a requirement must capture what
needs to be produced and not how to produce it.
Requirements Management Process
In order for requirements management to be effective you must establish and create an agreement
with the customer on requirement changes throughout the project. The first is requirements
development, which is the process of identifying and creating requirements based on the user
inputs and analysis. I found many different outlines when looking for an industry standard
requirements management process but all still focused on the main topics. We will discuss those
steps that are most crucial when defining the requirements management process.
Requirements Management Definition
This lays the foundation for the end product and provides a view of the intended solution. It also
provides the baseline for the design, testing and user acceptance. The practice of requirements
definition is typically performed in the planning phase of the project right before elicitation occurs.
It ensure the project meets objectives, deadlines, time constraints, and cost.
These are identified by asking questions like:
• What problem are we trying to resolve?
• What current and new resources do we need to solve the identified problem?
• Do your current processes provides a solution that doesn’t fit your short or long term needs?

After this point in the project the business analyst now collects and documents the final
requirements.
"Requirements management can be simplified if initial requirements definitions are captured in a
database-based tool to enable collaborative review... traceability and versioning/change
control” Matt Light, Research Director, Gartner.
Eliciting Requirements
Requirements elicitation is the practice of collecting the requirements of a system from users,
customers and other stakeholders. The practice is also sometimes referred to as "requirement
gathering".
During a normal requirements elicitation effort, it is likely that inputs will be received from
numerous sources. A team member begins taking the customers’ business needs and turns them
into actual requirements through the elicitation process. There are multiple meetings with clients,
subject matter experts, end-users of the current system, and many other stakeholders to begin
discussion about the projects goals. One early source of risk is the misunderstanding between users
and developers of what the requirement actually is. Elicitation meetings require a lot of
interviewing and meeting management skills in order to gather the information needed. It’s a good
practice to allocate sufficient time for gathering requirements.
When starting the elicitation process it’s important to find out if there are any existing systems
with the organization that may be similar to the one that is being requested. These systems that are
already in place can be studied and can potentially generate a new ideas on how the new solution
should work. Another way to get a head start on elicitation process is studying the current standard
software solutions that already exist in the market.
The analysts who perform the elicitation must be able to manage all stakeholders involved and not
focus just on one specific group. It’s key that all parties’ views and interests be acknowledged and
considered in fairness. It’s important that analysts be curious and open minded in hopes to leading
to fresh ideas and new perspectives. Analysts should never be afraid to ask “why” if they are
concerned with a customer’s requirement.
Some important skills needed for effective requirements is active listening, analyst must be able
to clearly articulate requirements, and also possess ability to align them with the projects goal. The
source of every requirement is typically from the expert so it’s important that the analysts have an
open mind and willingness to learn and understand from them. Another potential factor in
requirements elicitation is the politics involved. I came across an article that really provided good
detail into the truth behind what drives certain requirements and politics is certainly one of them.
Even though analysts might not agree, it’s important to understand that analysts shouldn’t place
certain stakeholders over others as it might lead to requirements that do not represent all parties
involved. Needless to say it takes a well-rounded analyst to elicit accurate and complete

requirements from a client. Remember elicitation should never come to an end until the project is
complete, it should be revisited throughout each phase to ensure accuracy.
Requirements Analysis
Requirements analysis is an important phase and can be used to identify key stakeholders. Creating
a list of key stakeholders ensures their needs are being considered in the risk assessment process.
If the client's requirements are not properly gathered and defined according to the information
provided by all stakeholders then the rest of the project is now off track when trying to arrive at a
solution. Requirements define capabilities that a system or a component needs to reach a solution
to a defined problem. They can be divided into two categories, functional and nonfunctional.
Functional requirements detail what a system should perform when a specific action is
taken. Nonfunctional requirements are the performance and system constraints that affect
development. It’s important when analyzing requirements that we reduce uncertainty early on in
the project. A possible suggestion to accomplish this is working backwards on the requirement
while considering the exact conditions that created the uncertainty.
Managing Requirement Changes
Uncontrolled changes can cause many different problem such as additional rework, lack of first
time quality, unpredictable schedules deviations and cost issues. Following a change process can
make requirement changes very easy to deal with. A requirements change process must be able to
propose, analyze, approve, and implement any changes within a requirement during any part of
the project. It’s also important to include an impact analysis study on what the change results might
be. This allows for better understanding of the requested change and improved planning for all
phases that will be impacted. All change requests must follow a certain process that has been
created or this effort will fail. Requirement changes may even sometimes require renegotiating
project commitments such as time, budgets, and resources. This is where it’s important to have
management buy in on the entire requirements management process.
Traceability (Recording)
Tracing allows for someone to manage the entire life of a requirement throughout the project. It
is important to understand how traceability helps ensure accurate delivery of clients’ needs and
expectations. Tracing is more closely related to systems development and is a discipline within
requirements management that can add a lot of value to a project. Traceability improves the scope
management within the project and could potentially prevent you from overseeing an identified
requirement. Sometimes requirements can be missed and it can lead to huge cost increases if it’s
implemented late in a project and can also potentially cause huge delays. Traceability also provides
the ability to track the priority of all requirements and their changes.
A study showed that 89% of initial requirements from project kick-off actually make it into the
final product. It is important to note that traceability can be difficult to implement without the
proper tools. If you do not have the right resources it can lead to cost overruns and its ends up not
being worth the benefit as originally assumed. Some potential best practices for traceability include

connecting test cases to the actual requirements, relating system requirements to their stakeholder’s
requirements and making sure your low level requirements can relate to the high level requirements
so you don’t cause any delays during implementation. In a lot of industries traceability isn’t a
practice anymore it’s more of a standard operating procedure and to some it might even be a
mandate. Please note that it’s important to trace your requirements into all phases such as design,
coding and testing phases of the project. By doing so you are eliminating a lot of risk!
Validation
According to a Project Management Institute study that involved over 2000 practitioners, its stated
organizations that use a formal validation process see significant improvement in project
outcomes. “We gather all the requirements and evaluate the project scope to understand the
mutual implications and validate project requirements.” Roberta Miglioranza, PMP, Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil
It’s very interesting to see how much more successful projects are when implementing validation
process properly.
Challenges
Like any and all project process challenges will be encountered and it’s important they are
identified and documented. A big challenge for a lot of organizations is getting upper level
management and executive leadership to support a RM process. Another few challenges that are
encountered when creating a RM process is that end users fail to use many of the system's
capabilities, or aren’t using them as they were intended for, or don’t even use the system at all.
Another big challenge is traceability or lack thereof within the requirements gathering. A study
done by PTC showed that only 1% of survey respondents indicate that requirements traceability
has no impact. When 99% of your responders agree that this is a crucial step, it must be
acknowledged by leadership.
There are many different reason that projects get cancelled and it’s know that poor requirements
management practices are consistently in the top 5, along with poor business alignment and
strategy changes. Many sources also cited management and technical reason why projects failed.
Another big challenge is traceability and the success of tracking it. That is why a larger project
should consider a RM tool to manage this difficult task. Change is inevitable so it’s a good idea to
be prepared to manage that change.
Best Practices
Best practices help create a standard operating procedure that ultimately leads to better a
requirements management system. It allows you to create a change control process that manages
the entire life of any requirement. It also provides the option for a version control process for the
entire documentation of any given requirement.

Some potential best practices for requirements management is listed below:
1. Create a RM standard/baseline that your organization follows
a. Management approved RM process for all projects
2. Implement a version control process for all documentation
a. all documentation is accurate and up to date
b. restrict access to authorized users
3. Create a change control process
4. Hold peer reviews to ensure accuracy
5. Avoid terms that aren’t fully understood
6. Create workshops to educate stakeholders on requirements
7. Utilize a requirements management tool (see information below on RM Tools)
RM Tools/ Software
Garnter estimates that over 80% of business analysts use Microsoft Office to define requirements.
Word can be used for text documents, excel can handle the large data sets, vizio is used for
diagraming and visual models and PPT for presentations and flow charts. Most companies that
engage in large projects start out by tracking their requirements by utilizing the Microsoft office
tools but eventually end up realizing that they need to transition to a more flexible management
software. Utilizing the Office suite might seem like a great idea from a cost side but it could end
up becoming insufficient for the complex IT needs. As projects become larger and more complex
Microsoft Office is shown to be very inadequate in meeting the needs of the business when it
comes to requirements management. RM tools offer version tracking, requirement history, and
most importantly the automatic tracking of changes at any point in the project. It’s important to
understand that some RM tools have additional costs such as setup fees, supports fees, and even
necessary training costs. Every project manager should weigh the pros and cons of the RM tool
based on the size of the project to determine if it is needed or the basic MS office application will
suffice. Today most requirements management tools are available via the cloud which makes
scalability an important determining factor for some companies.
Conclusion
Implementing a requirements management process leads to better results and is crucial to a projects
overall success. However, it’s important to create a standard requirements management process
in your organization in its efforts to produce consistent and high quality results.
CIO Magazine recently published a report that stated as many as “ 71% of software projects that
fail do so because of poor requirements management, making it the single biggest reason for
project failure – bigger than bad technology, missed deadlines or change management fiascoes.”
It’s also key that top level management and executive are aware of positive impacts a requirements
management process can have within an organization. PMI’s survey provides a great statistic on
that key item below. I leave you with a quote that I believe speaks directly to the importance of a
requirements management standard process for every organization.

“In my experience, people have been spending a lot of time on titles and terminology, and have
lost sight of the important work that drives outcomes. We need to put titles and terminology to the
side, and instead focus on the activities that contribute to the success of projects and programs.
Let’s pay attention to what really matters, and make some substantial improvements.” -- Mark A.
Langley, President and CEO, Project Management Institute
Regardless of the process your team uses to gather manage requirements, this process is key to the
development of any product or service. If the requirements management process is implemented
successfully quality results will be seen for a long time to come.
