### Q1: Explain why there is a great deal of variability in the requirements engineering processes used in different organizations?
RE processes vary radically from one organization to another. Factors contributing to this variability include:
- Technical maturity
- Disciplinary involvement
- Organization culture
- Application domain
There is no "ideal" requirements engineering process.

### Q2: Explain why both coarse-grain and fine-grain activity models of a process should be produced in an organizations.
Both of these models should be used in organizations as they provide more detailed capabilities.
Project manager, customer representatives, the general, top-level, or middle management require rather coarse-grained process description as they want to gain an overview of time, budget and resource planning for their decisions. In contrast, software engineers, users, testers, analysts or software system architect will prefer a fine-grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as the dependencies between people. 


### Q3: Explain why waterfall model of the software process is not an accurate reflection of the detailed software process in most organizations. Why spiral model is more realistic?
Change is inevitable. While working with a project, no one know when a certain unit/module will change or when a client will change their thoughts. Waterfall model assumes certain and complete knowledge/requirements before even beginning of the project. Hence, if a change occurs at a later stage, it is much more expensive to incorporate and sometimes ensues the end of the project. Whereas in Spiral model, software evolves as the process progresses and promotes quality assurance through prototyping at each stage. 

### Q4: Why is it important to understand the roles of people involved in requirements engineering processes?
Because to draw boundaries as in what should I (end-user) refine/document the user's requirement so that it is easier for the system-designers to implement. Moreover, it gives an overview of the whole team tackling certain tasks.

### Q5: What factors are likely to be particular significant when considering requirements engineering process involvement?
Human, social and organizational factors are particularly significant because they always involve a range of stakeholders from different backgrounds and with different individual and organizational goals.
